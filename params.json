My name is **Michał Piekarski** - for english speakers my name is Michael (the surname I won't translate, lets say it's something to with \"baker\").\r\nI'm a student at **Collegium Da Vinci in Poznań, Poland**.\r\n\r\n![Collegium Da Vinci logo](http://www.cdv.pl/gfx/logo2.png)\r\n\r\n## What do I do\r\n\r\nIn short I specialize in **programming**.\r\n\r\n### Programming\r\n\r\nMy main focus is on C-based languages like **C#** and **C++11**, but I also have an intimate relationship with **JavaScript (ES6)**.\r\nOther languages I know on a medium level are **Python3** and **Ruby**.\r\n\r\n<svg viewBox=\"0 0 128 128\">\r\n<path fill=\"#9B4F96\" d=\"M115.4 30.7l-48.3-27.8c-.8-.5-1.9-.7-3.1-.7-1.2 0-2.3.3-3.1.7l-48 27.9c-1.7 1-2.9 3.5-2.9 5.4v55.7c0 1.1.2 2.4 1 3.5l106.8-62c-.6-1.2-1.5-2.1-2.4-2.7z\"></path><path fill=\"#68217A\" d=\"M10.7 95.3c.5.8 1.2 1.5 1.9 1.9l48.2 27.9c.8.5 1.9.7 3.1.7 1.2 0 2.3-.3 3.1-.7l48-27.9c1.7-1 2.9-3.5 2.9-5.4v-55.7c0-.9-.1-1.9-.6-2.8l-106.6 62z\"></path><path fill=\"#fff\" d=\"M85.3 76.1c-4.2 7.4-12.2 12.4-21.3 12.4-13.5 0-24.5-11-24.5-24.5s11-24.5 24.5-24.5c9.1 0 17.1 5 21.3 12.5l13-7.5c-6.8-11.9-19.6-20-34.3-20-21.8 0-39.5 17.7-39.5 39.5s17.7 39.5 39.5 39.5c14.6 0 27.4-8 34.2-19.8l-12.9-7.6zM97 66.2l.9-4.3h-4.2v-4.7h5.1l1.2-6.2h4.9l-1.2 6.1h3.8l1.2-6.1h4.8l-1.2 6.1h2.4v4.7h-3.3l-.9 4.3h4.2v4.7h-5.1l-1.2 6h-4.9l1.2-6h-3.8l-1.2 6h-4.8l1.2-6h-2.4v-4.7h3.3zm4.8 0h3.8l.9-4.3h-3.8l-.9 4.3z\"></path>\r\n</svg>\r\n\r\n### Game developement\r\n\r\nMy main focus lately are **computer games**. I've been working with **Unity (version 4 and then 5)** at the beginning, but today I tend to shift more towards the **Unreal Engine 4**.\r\n\r\n## Other areas of interest\r\n\r\nI'm used to work in an **Agile** and **Lean** enviroments. Currently I'm a part of a team strongly incorporating **Scrum** in our day to day colaboration and project management.\r\nDespite beeing a programmer first of all, I have no problem to take on some siple design or even graphic work - but it's not as pretty as a professionals work of course - which comes very handy when creating first basic prototypes and proofs of concept without the need for a specialist graphic (it improves iteration rate immensely allowing for more exploration and experimentation with new technology and innovative solutions for projects).\r\n\r\n# How can You reach me\r\n\r\nThe simplest way is to go to <https://scan.me/michalpiekarski> where You can find direct links to all my social media and all flavours of online accounts - there is also more direct contact info like email, phone number or even my adres if You wan't to drop by for a coffee or a beer (just give me a heads up first ;) ).\r\n\r\nIf you're in a hurry below is some quick contact info:\r\n\r\n* Phone: [(+48) 792-102-168](tel:+48792102168)\r\n* E-mail: [michal.piekarski@icloud.com](mailto:michal.piekarski@icloud.com)\r\n* Telegram: [@michalpiekarski](https://telegram.me/michalpiekarski)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
