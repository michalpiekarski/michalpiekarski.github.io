My name is **Michał Piekarski** - for english speakers my name is Michael (the surname I won't translate, lets say it's something to with \"baker\").\r\nI'm a student at **Collegium Da Vinci in Poznań, Poland**.\r\n\r\n## What do I do\r\n\r\nIn short I specialize in **programming**.\r\n\r\n### Programming\r\n\r\nMy main focus is on C-based languages like **C#** and **C++11**, but I also have an intimate relationship with **JavaScript (ES6)**.\r\nOther languages I know on a medium level are **Python3** and **Ruby**.\r\n\r\n### Game developement\r\n\r\nMy main focus lately are **computer games**. I've been working with **Unity (version 4 and then 5)** at the beginning, but today I tend to shift more towards the **Unreal Engine 4**.\r\n\r\n## Other areas of interest\r\n\r\nI'm used to work in an **Agile** and **Lean** enviroments. Currently I'm a part of a team strongly incorporating **Scrum** in our day to day colaboration and project management.\r\nDespite beeing a programmer first of all, I have no problem to take on some siple design or even graphic work - but it's not as pretty as a professionals work of course - which comes very handy when creating first basic prototypes and proofs of concept without the need for a specialist graphic (it improves iteration rate immensely allowing for more exploration and experimentation with new technology and innovative solutions for projects).\r\n\r\n# How can You reach me\r\n\r\nThe simplest way is to go to <scan.me/michalpiekarski> where You can find direct links to all my social media and all flavours of online accounts - there is also more direct contact info like email, phone number or even my adres if You wan't to drop by for a coffee or a beer (just give me a heads up first ;) ).\r\n\r\nIf you're in a hurry below is some quick contact info:\r\nPhone: <(+48) 792-102-168>\r\nE-mail: <michal.piekarski@icloud.com>\r\nTelegram: <telegram.me/michalpiekarski>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
